# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## [SpaceX Launch Programs](https://priceless-sinoussi-8dfe47.netlify.app/)
This project uses [SpaceX API](https://api.spaceXdata.com/v3/launches?limit=100) to fetch the data to be displayed. Apart from just displaying the details it also allows the user to filter the data displayed on the screen using the sidemenu in medium and large screen devices, and on top in the mobile devices.
